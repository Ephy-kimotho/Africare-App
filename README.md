## üîß How we built it-
For AfyaCare, we employed a combination of technologies and services to create a comprehensive healthcare solution:

1. **Backend Development**: Developed a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js to handle requests for retrieving project data from the database. The API allows fetching all projects, specific project details, and supports pagination for large datasets.

2. **Frontend Integration**: Utilized React.js to build the client-side interface, enabling users to interact with the platform and access project information seamlessly. The frontend consumes the API to fetch project details and display them to users.

3. **AI Integration**: Incorporated Gemini AI to develop a DevOps FAQ and roadmap section, providing beginners with guidance on how to get started with healthcare management. This AI assistant enhances user experience by offering personalized assistance and answering common queries.

By integrating these technologies and services, AfriCare offers a comprehensive healthcare solution that empowers users to manage their health effectively, access relevant information, and engage in meaningful conversations within a supportive community environment.

## üí™ Challenges we ran into -
We could not properly implement the API to frontend because of time constrictions and we tried to make use of each and every tool in a creative and unique way possible. This project has still lot of potential and improvements to make. 

## üìå Accomplishments that we're proud of -
<img src="/screenshots/cli.png?raw=true">
Although we were not familiar with most of the tools and tech we used to build it, we tried and learned on the go to make it possible.

## üìö What we learned -
We learnt about react and how to make use of all the tools according to the use case of our project even if they were different and sometimes caused a lot of trouble.

## ‚è≠ What's next for -
Proper implementation of frontend to get all the projects from the API.
